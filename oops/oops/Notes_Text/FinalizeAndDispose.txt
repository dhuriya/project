Finalize Method in C#:
#1 The Finalize method is used for cleanup operations before an object is 
   garbage collected. It’s typically overridden to release unmanaged 
   resources that the object holds. The garbage collector calls the Finalize 
   method automatically.

#2 You do not call Finalize directly. It’s invoked by the garbage collector.

#3 The exact time when Finalize is called is non-deterministic, depending on 
   the garbage collector’s schedule

#4 The Finalize method is inherited from the Object class. It should always 
   call the Finalize method of its base class if overridden to ensure that 
   all resources are released properly.


Dispose Method: 
#1 The Dispose method is part of the IDisposable interface and is implemented 
   to release both managed and unmanaged resources deterministically.

#2 Unlike Finalize, Dispose is called explicitly in your code, usually when 
   you are done using an object. This allows for the immediate freeing of 
   resources

#3 Dispose provides a deterministic way to release resources, meaning you 
   know exactly when the resources are released.

#4 When implementing Dispose, it’s common to follow the dispose pattern, 
   which includes a finalizer call (GC.SuppressFinalize(this)) to prevent the 
   garbage collector from calling Finalize if Dispose has already been called.
